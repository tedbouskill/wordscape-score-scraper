# Notes:
# - This script sets up Python environments for multiple projects in a VS Code workspace.
# - It uses the initialize_python_environment function from the common.sh script to set up the Python environment for each project.
# - It finds the .code-workspace file at the root of the repository and extracts the project folders from it.
# - It iterates over each project folder and calls the initialize_python_environment function to configure the Python environment.
